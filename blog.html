                            "var" in JS is used to declare variables. It has global scope which means if declared
                            outside a function, it can be accessed from anywhere. "var" is hoisted. It means it is moved
                            to the top of its scope. At the top of the scope the variable is initialized not defined. It
                            is defined where it is actually declared. "var" can be redeclared and modified.

                            "let" are block scoped. They are also hoisted which means they are initialized at the top of
                            their scope but are not defined. They are defined where they are declared. Variables
                            declared with "let" can be modified.
                            <hr>
                            "const" have block-level scope. They have to be declared when initialzed. They cannot be
                            modified (elements is array and obj can be modified). "const" are not hoisted.

                            Sometimes it is used as a placeholder.

                            "undefined" is generally used by js in case where developer initializes a varibale but
                            doesn't put any value to it. In case of missing function arguments js also assigns
                            "undefined" to that argument. When we try to access any non-existent object property, we get
                            "undefined".

                            REST APIs are a set of principles for building and interacting with web services. They are
                            used to build web services. REST APIs allow web or mobile applications to interact with
                            server-side resources and perform operations like creating, reading, updating and deleting
                            data, which is known as CRUD. The data is transferred in a JSON format.
